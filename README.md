========================

Getting started with OpenRISC on terasic's SoCKit.

Getting started with OpenRISC can be quite daunting for
beginners. There is so much to learn. Fortunately the community is
very helpful. In order to diminish duplication of effort, this
tutorial was conceived out of the generous hours of support that
Stefan provided over IRC. This tutorial also provides some of the
supplemental files, for convenience.
